By data we mean
The facts
This publication documents the 12th edition of the Verbindigen / Jonctions festival which took place in Brussels from 21 to 29 November 2009. 
This bi-annual multidisciplinary festival is organized by Constant, association for art and media, with the intent to gather around the same table a large and diverse public - radio makers, artists, software programmers, academics, Linux users, interface designers, urban explorers, performance artists, technicians, lawyers and others – and to offer them the chance of experiencing each other’s practices and experimental reflections on technological culture and free licenses.
This edition was hosted at 17 rue de la Senne, in an open public space that Constant was invited to share with other organizations as part of the one-year program implemented by Ischa Tallieu and Jan Verbruggen with the intention of enhancing an abandoned building in the heart of Brussels. 
Through a series of conferences, work sessions and performances, three topics of discussion were proposed and explored:

    Shades of Grey Literature was an invitation to discover, play and worry about the mass of anonymous documents, commentaries and written traces which form the background    of electronic and non-electronic communication; as it frames the relationship between machines and humans and the way humans relate through networks, who has the right to see, read, write or execute?

    The Life and Nature of Data tried to answer the question: what is a data? To who or what it is handed over or where does it come from? Each electronic transaction leaves a trace; profiling of users is done in the interest of marketeers and advertisers, for state surveillance or to control the workplace; different practices all based on the extraction of information from “data”, an ambiguous entity always ready to mutate, multiply and         never loyal to its origins.      

    Performative Instructions analysed codes and norms that put themselves or others in motion. Users and developers exchange information through bug reports and error messages and confront issues of responsibility and authority put in place through manuals, recipes, forms and other types of instructions.

During the festival, the interventions varied from lectures discussing the ambiguity concealed in the Web language and in its abundant grey literature (Systemic ambiguity by Andrew Goffey and Matthew Füller, To talk of many things by Michael Moss) to a surgical analysis of the textual codes and standards of the Debian community (From source code to text code by Christophe Lazaro); from a Soap box annual report (by Ivan Monroy Lopez) to an on-line conversation about FLOSS manuals and practices (Fit for purpose); from a trans-disciplinary collaborative installation-performance around the usage of surveillance camera’s and softwares (Kaleidoscope by An Mertens) to a conference weighing the value and the appeal of privacy nowadays (Amidst the Golden Age of Privacy by Seda Gürses); from a philosophical and socio-anthropological theater adventure (Smatch(1) by Dominique Roodthooft) to a time-travel into the land of the paratext (From textual scholarship to the study of tradition by  Jurgen Pieters) to a presentation of new applications and platforms on Internet (GooDiff by Alexandre Delaunoy, Epicpedia by Annemieke and Marloes Van Der Hoek).
The three topics mentioned above and the different ways they were developed by the participants inspired us with the idea of a publication that brakes with the tradition of the printed catalog and responds instead to different criteria imposed by the very nature of the Web and to the possibilities opened up by the new media in terms of writing/editing a text or a book. 
The inspirational sources
Text vs Document
    convoluut
    Term uit de codicologie en (analytische) bibliografie voor een boek, waarin   
    handschriften of drukken, die wat hun ontstaan betreft niets met elkaar te maken    
    hebben, door een bezitter zijn samengebonden. Zo bevat de codex UB Leiden, Ltk. 191,  
    zes verschillende handschriften: Ferguut, Floris ende Blancefloer, Der historien
    bloeme, Esopet, Die bediedenisse vander missen in dietsche en Die dietsche doctrinael. 
    Indien het vanaf het begin af aan de bedoeling was de verschillende teksten in één 
    handschrift te bundelen, spreekt men van een verzamelhandschrift.

A codex (or convoluut or verzamelhandschrift2) was a manuscript in which a miscellany of various texts were bound together, sometimes without an apparent link. It was a sort of compendium or family book full of material and repertoire that could be use on different occasions. It appears to be quite common in Flanders in the Middle Ages. The banding was rather poor, the appearance business-like; the texts were generally written on two columns and at the bottom of each page the number of lines was indicated, since at that time the copyists were paid per line. This literary form seems to find an echo in the verb “to convolute” that means to coil up into a twisted shape, to roll up, but also to intertwine, to twist and turn, to make complicated3. 
The attempt to preserve documents that were generally not supposed to be public or even published, transforming them into a sort of journal of family life and events brought us back to the actual problem of witnessing in the most faithful and interesting way possible an event such as the Verbindingen / Jonctions 12. This collection of ante litteram grey litterature texts has been very inspiring in our idea of experiment with the material we had instead of merely make the texts accessible to the public via a printed publication. Several questions hunted us.
What does it means exactly a multi-disciplinary festival and its publication in terms of production of  grey litterature? Looking at the folder where we kept all sort of documents around the festival (invoices, tickets, forms, certificates, notes, etc.), at all the emails exchanged before, during and after the festival period, but still concerning it, all the material spread on the Web (photo's, videos, codes, reports, etc.), we started to realise that there was much more than solely the texts that the participants send to us after the festival, as agreed, to appear in our publication. 
Those texts in itself seemed to contain so much more than at a first glance in terms of references, quotes, footnotes, hyper-links that it felt like Alice falling down the rabbit hole and discovering a never-ending tunnel full of all kind of stuff4.
Text vs Document
Experimentation is certainly not a stranger to Constant publications.In the publications that followed each edition of the festival we tried different paths and more or less obvious breaks at the typical composition of a catalog / book. (to add some examples!)
The desire of going beyond (“literary”) codes and standards is therefore not a contemporary trend but it is inherent to the very history of literature and language, as Jurgen Pieters showed us in his analysis of the vision of Jerome McGann on the digital revolution and the way it affects the object “book”. Pieter's essay presents many references to various literary works very far from each other in terms of time and genre: from Dante's anthology La Vita Nuova5 in which the comments of the author are mixed with his own poems in a perfect alternation of prose and poetry to the lifelong project of Walter Benjamin of an encyclopedic collection of writings on the city life of Paris in the 19th century, The Arcades Project (Das Passagen-Werk, 1927-1940)6.
This kind of ambiguous model was further experimented in literature. An unique case in the history of litterature is represented by the Shinkokinshû (or new kokinshû), a Japanese anthology of poems (12th century) in which the cohesion of the work is ensured not only by a progressive system, but also by an associative one. Each unit is linked to the other through different mechanisms: association by categories of images, by words that bears a significance established by the poetic tradition, by key words (or kake kotoba) that have a double meaning or by pillow-words (or makura-kotoba), conventional epithets that form verses which refer to each other. This dense skein of connections and cross-references ping-ponging from one text to the other creates a complex and heterogeneous system of reading levels.
