<p>Presentation of an on-line edition of texts, images and reflections that
followed from the previous edition of <a href="http://constantvzw.org/vj12/"
    target="_blank">Jonctions/Verbindingen&nbsp;12: By Data We Mean.</a>.</p>
            
<p>This publication collects the different texts that were produced for the
lectures and presentation of VJ12. It also constitutes a platform for
experiments. What becomes possible when texts are released under a free
license? What happens when two texts apparently very different from each other,
but with many points of contact at a second reading, are brought together,
mixed, smashed, and suddenly acquire a completely different form and meaning?
Isn't every text ambiguous and being open to different interpretations? And how
can the grey literature surrounding textual production influences the process
of reading and decoding&nbsp;it?</p>

<p> All original versions of the texts produced after the festival are
available at <a
    href="http://www.constantvzw.org/verlag/spip.php?page=recherche&amp;recherche=verbindingen+jonctions+12"
    target="_blank">Constant Verlag</a>.</p>
