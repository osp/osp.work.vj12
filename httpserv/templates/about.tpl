<h1>By data we mean, a publication</h1>
<h2>The facts</h2>
<p>This publication documents the 12th edition of the Verbindigen/Jonctions
festival which took place in Brussels from 21 to 29 November 2009. </p>
<p>This bi-annual multidisciplinary festival is organized by Constant, Association
for Art and Media, with the intent to gather around the same table a large and
diverse public - radio makers, artists, software programmers, academics, Linux
users, interface designers, urban explorers, performance artists, technicians,
lawyers and others – and to offer them the chance of experiencing each other’s
practices and experimental reflections on technological culture and free
licenses.</p>
<p>This edition was hosted at 17 rue de la Senne, in an open public space that
Constant was invited to share with other organizations as part of the one-year
program implemented by Ischa Tallieu and Jan Verbruggen with the intention of
enhancing an abandoned building in the heart of Brussels. </p>
<p>Through a series of conferences, work sessions and performances, three topics
of discussion were proposed and explored:</p>
<p><strong>Shades of Grey Literature</strong> was an invitation to discover, play and worry
about the mass of anonymous documents, commentaries and written traces which
form the background    of electronic and non-electronic communication; as it
frames the relationship between machines and humans and the way humans relate
through networks, who has the right to see, read, write or execute?  <strong>The Life
and Nature of Data</strong> tried to answer the question: what is a data? To whom or
what is it handed over or where does it come from? Each electronic transaction
leaves a trace; profiling of users is done in the interest of marketeers and
advertisers, for state surveillance or to control the workplace; different
practices all based on the extraction of information from “data”, an ambiguous
entity always ready to mutate, multiply and         never loyal to its origins.
<strong>Performative Instructions</strong> analysed codes and norms that put themselves or
others in motion. Users and developers exchange information through bug reports
and error messages and confront issues of responsibility and authority put in
place through manuals, recipes, forms and other types of instructions.</p>
<p>During the festival, the interventions varied from lectures discussing the
ambiguity concealed in the Web language and in its abundant <em>grey literature</em>
(«Systemic Ambiguity» by Andrew Goffey and Matthew Fuller, «To Talk of Many
Things» by Michael Moss) to a surgical analysis of the textual codes and
standards of the Debian community («From Source Code to Text Code» by
Christophe Lazaro); from a Soap Box annual report (by Ivan Monroy Lopez) to an
on-line conversation of a software testing team in action («Fit for Purpose»);
from a trans-disciplinary collaborative installation-performance around the
usage of surveillance camera’s and software («Kaleidoscope, a genesis» by An
Mertens) to a conference weighing the charm and value of privacy today («Amidst
the Golden Age of Privacy» by Seda Gürses); from a philosophical and
socio-anthropological theater adventure («Smatch(1)» by Dominique Roodthooft)
to a time-travel into the land of the paratext («From Textual Scholarship to
the Study of Tradition» by  Jurgen Pieters) to a presentation of internet
applications for the critique of Web 2.0 («GooDiff» by Alexandre Delaunoy) or
webpage generating theatrical scripts from Wikipedia entries ( «Epicpedia» by
Annemieke and Marloes van der Hoek).</p>
<p>The three topics mentioned above and the different ways they were developed by
the participants inspired us with the idea of a publication that breaks with
the tradition of the printed catalog and is inspired by the interconnected
architecture of the internet and to the possibilities offered by digital media
in terms of writing/editing a text or a book. </p>
<h2>The inspirational sources</h2>
<h3>Text vs Document</h3>
<p><em>Convoluut</em> <em>Term uit de codicologie en (analytische) bibliografie voor een
boek, waarin handschriften of drukken, die wat hun ontstaan betreft niets met
elkaar te maken hebben, door een bezitter zijn samengebonden. Zo bevat de codex
UB Leiden, Ltk. 191, zes verschillende handschriften: "Ferguut, Floris ende
Blancefloer, Der historien bloeme, Esopet, Die bediedenisse vander missen in
dietsche en Die dietsche doctrinael. Indien het vanaf het begin af aan de
bedoeling was de verschillende teksten in één handschrift te bundelen, spreekt
men van een verzamelhandschrift."</em> LIT: BDI; Brongers; Gorp; Hiller; MEW. [W.
Kuiper]<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
<p>A <em>codex</em> (or <em>convoluut</em> or <em>verzamelhandschrift</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>) was a manuscript in
which a miscellany of various texts were bound together, sometimes without any
apparent connection. It was a sort of compendium or family book full of
material and a repertoire that could be used on different occasions. It appears
to be quite common in Flanders in the Middle Ages. The binding was rather poor,
the appearance business-like; the texts were generally written on two columns
and the bottom of each page showed the number of lines, since at that time the
copyists were paid per line. This literary form seems to find an echo in the
verb "to convolute" that means to coil up into a twisted shape, to roll up, but
also to intertwine, to twist and turn, to make complicated<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. </p>
<p>This attempt to preserve documents that were generally not supposed to be made
public or published, transforming them into a sort of journal of family life
and events, reminded us of a sort of collection of <em>ante litteram</em>, <em>grey
litterature</em> texts.  It was certainly very inspiring because it seemed to
coincide with our actual problem of witnessing in the most adequate, but at the
same time interesting way possible an event such as the Verbindingen/Jonctions
12. It gave us the idea of experimenting with the material we had (in the
widest sense of the term) instead of more traditionally make the texts of the
lectures accessible to the public via a printed publication. Several questions
haunted us.</p>
<h3>Which form should take the publication?</h3>
<p>Definitely on-line, since the network is the place par excellence of new
textual experimentations (e-readers, hypertexts, wikis, pads...).</p>
<p>What does a multi-disciplinary festival and its publication exactly mean in
terms of production of <em>grey litterature</em>?</p>
<p>We started looking for, collecting and classifying all the documents of every
kind  and form that were connected to the event. At first, it was just a very
generic research, writing down the locations, talking and exchanging mails with
Constant members, looking into the folder where we kept a big part of the
administration and production documents related to the festival (invoices,
tickets, forms, certificates, notes, etc.), losing ourselfves into the
intricate maze of the Constant websites to trace all the materials scattered on
the Web (photos, videos, codes, reports, etc.). We began to realise that there
was much more than solely the texts that the participants sent us after the
festival, as agreed, to appear in our publication. Was this "much more", this
V/J12 <em>grey litterature</em>, interesting enough to be shown? In what manner could
it affect the way in which the reader looks at a festival publication? Could
the writing production of an author exist without being surrounded by a dense
web of "grey" documents?</p>
<p>Of course we are not the only ones troubled by these issues. An example that is
worth mentioning is the beautiful work published on the occasion of the <em>Musée
Précaire Albinet</em> project (The Precarious Museum Albinet) by Thomas Hirschhorn
in 2004. The Swiss artist proposed the construction of a precarious building in
Aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris in France, with the aim of exhibiting major
Western art works of the twentieth century such as Marcel Duchamp, Salvador
Dalí and Andy Warhol. The "museum" was built and operated with the help of the
inhabitants. Throughout the project development, Thomas Hirschhorn and the
Laboratoires d'Aubervilliers kept the documents relating to this collective
work: the set of written texts exchanged with the partners, the traces of
various meetings between the artistic team and the citizens as well as the
production inherent to the operational aspect of the museum and the newspaper
articles. The result was an important archive that was reworked in the catalog
as an annotated chronology put into perspective by the artist<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>. Almost all
the (textual and visual) documentation is represented and classified according
to genre, date, sender, recipient, subject. These documents form a dense and
fascinating amalgam that tells the history of the project from within.</p>
<p>In the case of our publication, the documents have been sorted by a "natural
selection" due to time constraints rather than a reasoned choice. (a enlever je
crois)</p>
<h3>Beyond the text</h3>
<p>Alongside the work of collecting the documents, there was also the idea of
rethinking the essays and articles we received from the participants. While
reading and re-reading these texts and watching them more closely, we observed
that they seemed to contain another huge amount of "material" taking the shape
of references, quotes, footnotes and hyperlinks. At that point, we felt like
Alice falling down the rabbit hole and discovering a never-ending tunnel full
of all kind of stuff<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Experimentation is certainly not a new thing for Constant. In the publications
that followed each edition of the festival we often tried different paths and
more or less subtle breaks at the typical composition of a catalog / book. (to
add some examples!)  (a enlever je crois)</p>
<p>The desire of going beyond ("literary") codes and standards is therefore not a
contemporary trend but is intrinsic to the very history of literature and
language. Jurgen Pieters showed it beautifully in his analysis of the vision of
Jerome McGann on the digital revolution and the way it affects the object
"book". Pieters' essay presents many references to various literary works very
far from each other in terms of time and genre: from Dante's anthology <em>La Vita
Nuova</em><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> in which the comments of the author are mixed with his own poems in
a perfect alternation of prose and poetry, to <em>The Arcades Project</em> (<em>Das
Passagen-Werk</em>, 1927-1940)<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>, an encyclopedic collection of writings on the
city life of Paris in the 19th century, the lifelong project of Walter
Benjamin.</p>
<p>A unique case in the history of literature we stumbled on during our research,
is represented by the <em>Shinkokinshû</em> (or new <em>kokinshû</em>), a Japanese anthology
of poems (from the 12th century) in which the cohesion of the work is ensured
not only by a linear structure, but also by an associative one<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>. Each unit
in fact is linked to the other through different mechanisms: association by
categories of images, by words that bears a common meaning established by the
poetic tradition, by key words (or <em>kake kotoba</em>) that have a double meaning,
or by pillow-words (or <em>makura-kotoba</em>), conventional epithets that form verses
which refer to each other. This dense skein of connections and cross-references
ping-ponging from one poem to the other creates a complex and heterogeneous
system of reading levels. </p>
<p>However, writers and avant-garde literary movements have sought new ways,
opening the way for unpredictable reading experiences. Just think of the
"visual poems" of Guillaume Apollinaire<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> or the <em>parole in libertà</em> (Free
Words) proclaimed by the Italian Futurists<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> or the self-imposed constrained
writing techniques of the members of the OULIPO (<em>OUvroir de LIttérature
POtentielle</em>, roughly translated: 'workshop of potential literature')<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">15</a></sup>. </p>
<p>In the last century, the digital revolution and the advent of the Internet have
certainly shaken the literary world as well as other artistic fields. Theorists
and artists are pushed to rethink the idea of text, of narrative, of fiction,
even of a book in its most concrete form. Moreover, the development of
technology linked to electronic networks has offered them new tools for text
processing, breaking through the classical "horizontal structure" of a
publication in which more texts are put next to each other or of a narration
presented in a follow-up. Thanks to hyperlinks, specific words become links to
other texts, each of which is in turn accompanied by references and links to
other texts, images, videos and all kinds of documentation. Each text is no
longer secluded into the limited size of a page or into the limited number of
pages of a book. The possibilities are multiplied and become endless.
Hypertext<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> writing developed its own style of fiction<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">17</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>The experiments When we left behind the theoretical research and we started</h2>
<p>working directly with the material we had collected, we found ourselves in the
middle of a battle field between <em>convoluut</em> and indexed documents, between
<em>grey litterature</em> and original essays, between paratext<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">18</a></sup>, intertext and
hypertext.  Different experiments started to take form and to become the real
body of this publication.</p>
<h3>Micro/Macro Following the theme of the 12th edition of the festival, we</h3>
<p>decided to show all the <em>grey literature</em> then produced, in the form of a
timeline that allowed us to see the greater and lesser dense periods in the
production of the festival and to analyse and compare the metadata embodied by
each document. This works on a "macro" scale (the festival) but also on a
"micro" scale represented by two specific events, the lectures «Systemic
Ambiguity» by Andrew Goffey and Matthew Fuller and «To Talk of Many Things» by
Michael Moss and how they were used to produce a textual re-mix. A second
timeline features the annotation of the video recording of Michael Moss lecture
during an Active Archive workshop.</p>
<p>(il faut parler aussi l'experimentation de Stéphanie et Alex sur le
macro/micro)</p>
<h3>Re-Mixing up We wanted to explore how it is possible to make visible some</h3>
<p>of the associations that a human mind makes while writing or reading a text by
criss-crossing texts. These "correspondances"  are often shown adding footnotes
with references to other essays or creating direct hyperlinks to other
webpages. Even though intertextuality, the allusion or influence by a prior
text<sup id="fnref:INTERTEXT"><a href="#fn:INTERTEXT" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, has always been present in <em>any</em> text<sup id="fnref:FEDERMAN"><a href="#fn:FEDERMAN" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, the use of
free licenses in the texts of V/J12 invites us to explore and experiment it
more deeply. By willingly releasing their texts under licenses allowing
derivative works, the authors of the text gave us the opportunity to perform
hybridations. And the result of our remix can be considered as an invitation to
others to realize their own and share them in return.  We started to play with
some texts, trying to push the boundaries of interpretation. What happens in
fact when two texts apparently very different from each other, but with many
common points at a second reading, are brought together, mixed, smashed up? Do
they suddenly acquire a completely different form and meaning? Isn't each text
ambiguous in itself, being open to different interpretations and how can  the
notes and references it contains influence the process of reading and decoding
it?</p>
<p>We chose three different approaches that derived from the very nature of the
texts: essays, report/testimony, discussion/personal annotations: «To Talk of
Many Systemic Ambiguity», in which «Systemic Ambiguity» by Andrew Goffey and
Matthew Fuller and «To Talk of Many Things by Michael Moss are mixed together
with the footnotes and the references present in «Systemic Ambiguity», creating
an autonomous text, extremely rich, complex and understandable;
«KaleidoSmatch», in which «Kaleidoscope, a genesis» by An Mertens and
«Smatch(1)» by          Dominique Roodthooft are presented as a parallel
narration about two  different theatre experiences, sharing the layout and the
use of images  and hyperlinks; «Fit the Annual Report on Purpose», in which
«Fit for Purpose» by the FLOSS developers and «Soap Box annual report» by Ivan
Monroy Lopez are carried out as a theatre piece in three acts with Ivan as a
voiceover.</p>
<p>The original texts are of course available on Constant's website. These
remixes, however, reveal totally unexpected, new and playful interpretations of
the originals. Of course, all of this was possible thanks to the fact that
these texts are under a free artistic license. Can the use of free licenses
represent a new frontier in terms of experimental writing? Or does it put even
more in question the concept of "original" work? The results of our
experimentations are surely not anymore what the texts were in the beginning.
We didn't try to replicate them, we tried somehow to go through and beyond
them, to enrich them with new possible reading patterns stimulated by the
original texts.</p>

<h3>NLTK Using NLTK<sup id="fnref:NLTK"><a href="#fn:NLTK" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, we want to observe what different results the</h3>
<p>computer can find when comparing texts than what human logic can. Therefore, we
used the same couples of texts than in the remixes to have a different
approach. Each couple can be filtered through three sorting methods: by
"concordances" (viewing in what context the same word appears in both texts);
by "similar contexts" (finding words sharing the same context in both texts);
by "collocations" (finding couples of words in both texts).</p>

<h3>Paracode The term paratext is coined by Gérard Genette in 1987. It gathers</h3>
<p>all the text elements around the text itself which are usually considered as
secondary and sometimes optional (some elements of the paratext are added or
removed from one edition to another). This "grey" text is "a zone not only of
transition but also of transaction: a privileged place of pragmatics and a
strategy, of an influence on the public, an influence that [...] is at the
service of a better reception for the text and a more pertinent reading of it."
<sup id="fnref:GENETTE"><a href="#fn:GENETTE" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> In <em>Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation</em>, Genette draws up a
list of all paratext elements of a book (fiction, non-fiction, poetry...). We
are trying through the close-reading of a piece of software, written by
Anne-Laure Buisson for V/J12, to find new paratext elements specific to the
digital nature of a contemporary text, and more precisely, of a piece of code:
a text which is supposed to be read by a specific public (sometimes the author
himself), a text which has a precise function.</p>

<h2>Conclusions This publication constitutes eventually a platform for</h2>
<p>experimentation. Even if we maybe didn't address all the issues in depth, still
we hope to have given to the reader a series of possible paths to be further
explored and to have opened up new interpretations and possibilities of
building his own post-festival journey through a forest of many different
documents and texts. We hope you will enjoy it. </p>

<p>faculty, should find himself in a zone of intense life to recount his
impressions. Do you know what your lyrical friend will do while he is still
shocked?... He will begin by brutally destroying the syntax of his speech. He
will not waste time in constructing periodic sentences. He could care less
about punctuation or finding the right adjective. He desdains subtleties and
shadings, and in haste he will assault your nerves with visual, auditory and
olfactory sensations, just as their insistent pressure in him demands. The rush
of steam-emotion will burst the steampipe of the sentence, the valves of
punctuation, and the regular clamp of the adjective. Fistfuls of basic words
without a conventional order. Only preoccupation of the narrator, to render all
the vibrations of his "I".» in «Distruzione della sintassi/Immaginazione senza
