<h1>By data we mean, a publication</h1>
<b>The facts</b><br />
<br />
This publication documents the 12th edition of the
Verbindigen/Jonctions festival which took place in Brussels from 21
to 29 November 2009.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This bi-annual multidisciplinary festival is organized by Constant,
Association for Art and Media, with the intent to gather around the
same table a large and diverse public - radio makers, artists,
software programmers, academics, Linux users, interface designers,
urban explorers, performance artists, technicians, lawyers and
others – and to offer them the chance of experiencing each other’s
practices and experimental reflections on technological culture and
free licenses.<br />
<br />
This edition was hosted at 17 rue de la Senne, in an open public
space that Constant was invited to share with other organizations
as part of the one-year program implemented by Ischa Tallieu and
Jan Verbruggen with the intention of enhancing an abandoned
building in the heart of Brussels.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Through a series of conferences, work sessions and performances,
three topics of discussion were proposed and explored:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Shades of Grey Literature</b> was an invitation to discover,
play and worry about the mass of anonymous documents, commentaries
and written traces which form the background&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of
electronic and non-electronic communication; as it frames the
relationship between machines and humans and the way humans relate
through networks, who has the right to see, read, write or
execute?</li>
<li><b>The Life and Nature of Data</b> tried to answer the
question: what is a data? To whom or what is it handed over or
where does it come from? Each electronic transaction leaves a
trace; profiling of users is done in the interest of marketeers and
advertisers, for state surveillance or to control the workplace;
different practices all based on the extraction of information from
“data”, an ambiguous entity always ready to mutate, multiply
and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; never loyal to
its origins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Performative Instructions</b> analysed codes and norms that
put themselves or others in motion. Users and developers exchange
information through bug reports and error messages and confront
issues of responsibility and authority put in place through
manuals, recipes, forms and other types of instructions.<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>
During the festival, the interventions varied from lectures
discussing the ambiguity concealed in the Web language and in its
abundant <i>grey literature (Systemic ambiguity</i> by Andrew
Goffey and Matthew Füller, <i>To talk of many things</i> by Michael
Moss) to a surgical analysis of the textual codes and standards of
the Debian community (<i>From source code to text code</i> by
Christophe Lazaro); from a Soap box annual report (by Ivan Monroy
Lopez) to an on-line conversation about FLOSS manuals and practices
(<i>Fit for purpose</i>); from a trans-disciplinary collaborative
installation-performance around the usage of surveillance camera’s
and software (<i>Kaleidoscope</i> by An Mertens) to a conference
weighing the charm and value of privacy today (<i>Amidst the Golden
Age of Privacy</i> by Seda Gürses); from a philosophical and
socio-anthropological theater adventure (<i>Smatch(1)</i> by
Dominique Roodthooft) to a time-travel into the land of the
paratext (<i>From textual scholarship to the study of tradition</i>
by&nbsp; Jurgen Pieters) to a presentation of new applications and
platforms on Internet (<i>GooDiff</i> by Alexandre Delaunoy,
<i>Epicpedia</i> by Annemieke and Marloes van der Hoek).<br />
<br />
The three topics mentioned above and the different ways they were
developed by the participants inspired us with the idea of a
publication that brakes (breaks?) with the tradition of the printed
catalog and responds instead to the different criteria imposed by
the very nature of the Web and to the possibilities opened up by
the new media in terms of writing/editing a text or a
book.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<br />
<b><i>Text vs Document</i></b><br />
<br />
<br />
convoluut<br />
Term uit de codicologie en (analytische) bibliografie voor een
boek, waarin handschriften of drukken, die wat hun ontstaan betreft
niets met elkaar te maken hebben, door een bezitter zijn
samengebonden. Zo bevat de codex UB Leiden, Ltk. 191, zes
verschillende handschriften: <i>Ferguut</i>, <i>Floris ende
Blancefloer</i>, <i>Der historien bloeme</i>, <i>Esopet</i>, <i>Die
bediedenisse vander missen in dietsche</i> en <i>Die dietsche
doctrinael</i>. Indien het vanaf het begin af aan de bedoeling was
de verschillende teksten in één handschrift te bundelen, spreekt
men van een verzamelhandschrift.<br />
LIT: BDI; Brongers; Gorp; Hiller; MEW. [W. Kuiper]1<br />
<br />
A <i>codex</i> (or <i>convoluut</i> or verzamelhandschrift2) was a
manuscript in which a miscellany of various texts were bound
together, sometimes without any apparent content link. It was a
sort of compendium or family book full of material and repertoire
that could be used on different occasions. It appears to be quite
common in Flanders in the Middle Ages. The banding (binding?) was
rather poor, the appearance business-like; the texts were generally
written on two columns and the bottom of each page showed the
number of lines, since at that time the copyists were paid per
line. This literary form seems to find an echo in the verb “to
convolute” that means to coil up into a twisted shape, to roll up,
but also to intertwine, to twist and turn, to make
complicated3.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This attempt to preserve documents that were generally not supposed
to be made public or published, transforming them into a sort of
journal of family life and events, reminded us of a sort of
collection of <i>ante litteram</i>: <i>grey litterature</i>
texts.&nbsp;<br />
It was certainly very inspiring because it seemed to coincide with
our actual problem of witnessing in the most faithful and
interesting way possible an event such as the
Verbindingen/Jonctions 12. It gave us the idea of experimenting
with the material we had (in the widest sense of the term) instead
of merely make the texts of the lectures accessible to the public
via a printed publication. Several questions hunted us.<br />
<br />
Which form should take the publication?<br />
<br />
Definitly on-line, since the network is the place <i>par
excellence</i> of new textual experimentations (e-readers,
hypertexts, wikis, pads...).<br />
<br />
What does a multi-disciplinary festival and its publication exactly
mean in terms of production of <i>grey litterature</i>?<br />
<br />
We started looking for, collecting and classifying all the
documents of every genre and form that were connected to the event.
At first, it was just a very generic kind of research, writing down
the locations, talking and exchanging mails with Constant members,
looking into the folder where we kept a big part of the
administration and production documents related to the festival
(invoices, tickets, forms, certificates, notes, etc.), losing
ourselfves into the wibes (vibes?) of the Constant websites to
trace all the materials scattered on the Web (photos, videos,
codes, reports, etc.). We began to realise that there was much more
than solely the texts that the participants sent us after the
festival, as agreed, to appear in our publication. Was this "much
more", this V/J12 "grey litterature," interesting enough to be
shown? In what manner could it affect the way in which the reader
looks at a festival publication?<br />
<br />
Of course we are not the only ones troubled by these issues. An
example that is worth mentioning is the beautiful work published on
the occasion of the <i>Musée Précaire Albinet</i> project (The
Precarious Museum Albinet) by Thomas Hirschhorn in 2004. The Swiss
artist proposed the construction of a precarious building in
Aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris in France, with the aim of
exhibiting major Western art works <s>of the history</s> of the
twentieth century <s>Western art</s> such as Marcel Duchamp,
Salvador Dalí and Andy Warhol. The "museum" was built and operated
with the help of the inhabitants. Throughout the project
development, Thomas Hirschhorn and the Laboratoires d'Aubervilliers
kept the documents relating to this collective work: the set of
written texts exchanged with the partners, the traces of various
meetings between the artistic team and the citizens as well as the
production inherent to the operational aspect of the museum and the
newspaper articles. The result was an important archive that was
reworked in the catalog as an annotated chronology put into
perspective by the artist4. Almost all the (textual and visual)
documentation is represented and classified according to genre,
date, sender, recipient, subject. It forms a dense and fascinating
amalgam that tells a story poorly purged out of the
surplus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In the case of our publication, the documents have been sorted by a
"natural selection" due to time constraints rather than a reasoned
choice.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Beyond the text</i></b><br />
<br />
Alongside the work of collecting the documents, there was also the
idea of rethinking the essays and articles we received from the
participants. While reading and re-reading these texts and watching
them more closely, we observed that they seemed to contain another
huge amount of "material" in terms of (taking the shape
of/cristallizing into ?) references, quotes, footnotes and
hyperlinks. At that point, we felt like Alice falling down the
rabbit hole and discovering a never-ending tunnel full of all kind
of stuff5.<br />
<br />
Experimentation is certainly not a new thing for Constant. In the
publications that followed each edition of the festival we often
tried different paths and more or less subtle breaks at the typical
composition of a catalog / book. <b>(to add some
examples!)</b><br />
<br />
The desire of going beyond ("literary") codes and standards is
therefore not a contemporary trend but is intrinsic to the very
history of literature and language. Jurgen Pieters showed it
beautifully in his analysis of the vision of Jerome McGann on the
digital revolution and the way it affects the object "book".
Pieters' essay presents many references to various literary works
very far from each other in terms of time and genre: from Dante's
anthology <i>La Vita Nuova6</i> in which the comments of the author
are mixed with his own poems in a perfect alternation of prose and
poetry, to <i>The Arcades Project</i> (<i>Das Passagen-Werk</i>,
1927-1940)7, an encyclopedic collection of writings on the city
life of Paris in the 19th century, the lifelong project of Walter
Benjamin.<br />
<br />
A unique case in the history of literature we stumbled on during
our research, is represented by the <i>Shinkokinshû</i> (or new
<i>kokinshû</i>), a Japanese anthology of poems (from the 12th
century) in which the cohesion of the work is ensured not only by a
progressive system, but also by an associative one8. Each unit in
fact is linked to the other through different mechanisms:
association by categories of images, by words that bears a common
meaning established by the poetic tradition, by key words (or
<i>kake kotoba</i>) that have a double meaning, or by pillow-words
(or <i>makura-kotoba</i>), conventional epithets that form verses
which refer to each other. This dense skein of connections and
cross-references ping-ponging from one poem to the other creates a
complex and heterogeneous system of reading levels.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, writers and avant-garde literary movements have sought new
ways, opening the way for unpredictable reading experiences. Just
think of the "visual poems" of Guillaume Apollinaire9 or the
<i>parole in libertà</i> (Free Words) proclaimed by the Italian
Futurists10 or the self-imposed constrained writing techniques of
the members of the OULIPO (<i>OUvroir de LIttérature
POtentielle</i>, roughly translated: 'workshop of potential
literature')11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<br />
In the last century, the digital revolution and the advent of the
Internet have certainly shaken the literary world as well as other
artistic fields. Theorists and artists are pushed to rethink the
idea of text, of narrative, of fiction, even of a book in its most
concrete form. Moreover, the development of technology linked to
electronic networks has offered them new tools for text processing,
breaking through the classical "horizontal structure" of a
publication in which more texts are put <s>one</s> next to each
<s>the</s> other or of a narration presented in a follow-up. Thanks
to hyperlinks, specific words become links to other texts, each of
which is in turn accompanied by references and links to other
texts, images, videos and all kinds of documentation. Each text is
no longer secluded into the limited size of a page or into the
limited number of pages of a book. The possibilities are multiplied
and become endless. Hypertext12 writing developed its own style of
fiction13.<br />
<br />
<b>The experiments</b><br />
<br />
When we left behind the theoretical research and we started working
directly with the material we have collected, we found ourselves in
the middle of a battle field between <i>convoluut</i> and indexed
documents, between <i>grey litterature</i> and original essays,
between partext1 (paratext? Is it related to footnote 1?) and
hypertext.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Different experiments started to take form and to become the real
body of this publication.<br />
<br />
<i>Re-Mixing up</i><br />
<br />
First of all, we came up with the idea of criss-crossing texts. We
wanted to explore how it is possible to make visible some of the
associations that a human mind makes while writing or reading a
text. These "correspondances" are often shown adding footnotes with
references to other essays or creating direct hyperlinks to other
webpages. We chose three different approaches that derived from the
very nature of the texts: essays, report/testimony,
discussion/personal annotations. We started to play with some
texts, trying to push the boundaries of interpretation. What
happens in fact when two texts apparently very different from each
other, but with many more points of contact at a second reading,
are brought together, mixed, smashed up, and suddenly acquire a
completely different form and meaning? Isn't each text ambiguous in
itself, being open to different interpretations and how can the
notes and references it contains, influence the process of reading
and decoding it?<br />
<br />
We came up with three very different "remixes":&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><i>To Talk of Many Systemic Ambiguity,</i> in which <i>Systemic
Ambiguity</i> by Andrew Goffey and Matthew Fuller and <i>To Talk of
Many Things</i> by Michael Moss are mixed together with the
footnotes and the references present in <i>Systemic Ambiguity</i>,
creating an autonomous text, extremely rich, complex and
understandable;</li>
<li><i>KaleidoSmatch</i>, in which <i>Kaleidoscope</i> by An
Mertens and <i>Smatch(1)</i>
by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dominique
Roodthooft are presented as a parallel narration about two
different theatre experiences, sharing the layout and the use of
images and hyperlinks;</li>
<li><i>Fit the Annual Report on Purpose</i>, in which&nbsp; <i>Fit
for Purpose</i> by the FLOSS developers and "Soap Box annual
report" by Ivan Monroy Lopez are carried out as a theatre piece in
three acts with Ivan as a voiceover.<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>
The original texts are of course available on Constant's website.
These remixes, however, reveal totally unexpected, new and playful
interpretations of the originals.<br />
<br />
<i>NLTK&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
Using <s>an existing program, the</s> NLTK (Natural Language
ToolKit), we try to explore two texts we remixed to test a
different way of language processing and text analysis.<br />
This program allowed us to connect <i>Systemic Ambiguity</i> by
Andrew Goffey and Matthew Fuller and <i>To Talk of Many Things</i>
by Michael Moss through three sorting methods:<br />
by "concordances<i>"</i> (viewing in what context the same word
appears in both texts), by "similar contexts" (finding words
sharing the same context in both texts) and by "collocations"
(finding couples of words in both texts).<b>(to be
improved!)</b><br />
<br />
<i>Micro/Macro</i><br />
<br />
We decided to show all the <i>grey literature</i> produced by the
festival in the form of a timeline that allowed us to see the
greater and lesser density periods in the production of the
festival and to analyse and compare the metadata embodied by each
document. This works on a "macro" scale (the festival) but also on
a "micro" scale represented by two specific events, the lectures
<i>Systemic Ambiguity</i> by Andrew Goffey and Matthew Fuller and
<i>To Talk of Many Things</i> by Michael Moss.<b>(to be
improved!)</b><br />
<br />
<i>Paracode</i><br />
<br />
We finally proposed a close-reading of a piece of software written
by Anne-Laure Buisson for the festival <s>occasion</s>.<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusions</b><br />
<br />
This publication constitutes eventually a platform for
experimentation. Even if we maybe didn't address all the issues in
depth, still we hope to have given to the reader a series of
possible paths to be further explored and to have opened up new
interpretations and possibilities of building his own post-festival
journey through a forest of many different documents and texts. We
hope you will enjoy it.&nbsp;<br />
