    <h1>Smatch (1), a genesis</h1>


    <blockquote>“Si je me suis intéressée aux animaux, C'est d'abord
    parce que j'ai été très attirée par le caractère de leurs
    spécialistes: ce sont des gens passionnés, joyeux et extrêmement
    inventifs.” (Vinciane Despret)</blockquote>
<div class="img" style="width: 180px; height: 257px">
    <img src="smatch/smatch.jpg" />
</div>
<div>
     <p>
     <em><a href="http://www.lecorridor.be/Sp-smatch.php">Smatch</a></em> was born from the carte
    blanche I received from <a href="http://performingarts.jp/E/pre_interview/0802/1.html">Cristophe Slagmuylder</a>,
    <a href="http://www.kfda.be/">KFDA</a>’s director. I could do
    whatever I wanted: a show, a performance, an exhibition … quite an
    open offer.
        </p>
    <p>After thinking about it for a couple
    of days (I had nothing going on at the time), I proposed a form
    which I would call<em>Smatch</em>.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p><em>Smatch</em> is a contraction of two
    conflicting verbs: <a href=
    "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/smash">to
    smash</a> (break, wreck) and
    <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/match">to match</a> (correspond, go
    together).</p>

    <p><em>Smatch</em> sounds like good English, and it also sounds like bad English;
    in that way, it is a knowing wink at our poor knowledge of
    languages in <a href=
    "http://www.belgiumtheplaceto.be/wallonia.php">Wallonia</a>.</p>

    <p>I had been dreaming for a while of finding a space, a
    place where one could stop and think joyously with the audience and
    with the actors.</p>

    <p>The theme of the <em>Smatch (1)</em> – there will be others –
    bears the following title: <em>Drive a monkey
    crazy and you bring a crazy monkey into being</em>.</p>

    <p>It’s a reaction to the sense [sensation might work
    better] that over the past several years we have been plunged
    deeper and deeper and faster and faster into a catastrophism (I’ve
    been fighting that against for years) that ultimately smashes us
    under the weight of impotence.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>The
    title, <a href=
    "http://culture.ulg.ac.be/jcms/prod_198088/ethologie-philosophie-dramaturgie?part=2">
    Drive a monkey crazy and you’ll bring a crazy
    monkey into being</a>, is inspired by an
    experiment conducted by <a href=
    "http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/harlow.htm">
    Harry Harlow</a>, a famous American
    psychologist who wanted to show his peers the psychological damage
    that might afflict a child deprived of a bond to his or her mother.
    To do that, he bust up hundreds of baby
    rhesus monkeys (he separated from their mothers at birth to put
    them in cages) solely for the purposes of giving statistic proof
    for something that everyone had known already for quite some time …
    The study was conducted right after WWII, and people had already
    started to notice that children in many orphanages were suffering
    enormous trauma.</p>

    <p>I had also been wanting to work
    with animals for a while. The title, taken from a sentence in a
    book by <a href=
    "http://vincianedespret.blogspot.com/">Vinciane Despret</a>
    (<a href=
    "http://www.betesethommes.fr/"><em>Bêtes et
    Hommes</em></a>), sent me back to my
    ‘pre-Conservatory’ days – I started at the Conservatory when I was
    thirty; before that, I had worked for eight years as an social
    assistant in a psycho-medical-social centre.</p>
</div>


    <h6>Expectations&hellip;</h6>

<div>
    <p>That period
    of my life – I am telling you about this because that period and my
    stage work intersect in places – allowed me to meet early on people
    who prompted me to think about the foundations that would continue
    to guide my life. The phenomenon of expectation, for example.
    During a university summer course (these exist in France), I got to
    work with Odette and Henri Bassis, the founders of the
    <a href="http://www.gfen.asso.fr/fr/historique">Groupe Français d’Éducation Nouvelle</a>, a militant pedagogical movement very much engaged with the
    problem of how to guarantee that all children pass while
    maintaining a very high standard. A day of the conference was
    devoted to discussing the question of expectation in the learning
    process.</p>

    <p>And there came the shock … Suddenly, I felt I
    understood deep down to which extent when one expects
    something from a person or situation (something that is not there
    at the outset), one arranges everything (more often than not
    unconsciously) to ensure the realization of the expectation.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Secondly, it
    didn’t take long for my first job to give me the impression that
    things had already been decided and settled, and this before they
    had happened and regardless of the desires of individuals. My role
    was in fact determined by the institution: contact the parents of
    children who were having problems at school, study the source of
    the problem with them, and help the family find
    solutions.</p>

    <p>My role was predetermined. What the institution
    wanted – that is what I want to get to – was one thing, and what I
    wanted was another. Invariably, there was conflict between what I
    wanted to do, and what the institution asked me to do. Teachers
    wanted to distance themselves from the failures of one or another
    child, and my mission was to meet the families of the kids in
    question and basically tell them that they had to find a different
    way to take care of their kids; and psychologists from the PMS, on
    their side, clung to their functions a examiners/councilors, and
    they rarely did anything other than what the teacher wanted them to
    do, viz.: say that the student had psychological or family problems
    and thus had to be directed towards schools for special learning,
    unless the family shaped up. The responsibility for solving school
    problems was always extrinsic to the school itself.</p>

    <p>I actually spent a great deal of
    time turning down the requests of teachers after having analyzed
    them. To make them assume their responsibilities, to make them
    committee to working in the classroom (inventing new organizations) to make sure that all the children
    in the class – especially the ones for whom studying at home was
    impossible – passed. I also quickly abandoned the idea of meeting
    families whose failing track record at school could sometimes stretch across three generations and who were
    beset by social problems to tell them that they had to change their
    attitude at home for their kid to be able to thrive at
    school.</p>

    <p>The second enduring lesson I learned while working in
    the fields of institutional analysis and institutional psychology
    is that the institution, and hence the organization that
    underwrites it, makes the person, so that by changing institutions,
    the person is – almost naturally – transformed.</p>

    <p>These reflections prompted two institutional changes
    in the PMS centre I used to work at. One is that psychologists
    stopped giving teachers the results of the IQ tests administered to
    the students; the second is that a bad record did not follow the
    student from one school to another.</p>

    <p>I continued to cope with those contradictions until
    the incident with Simon, another story of humans and animals. A
    teacher wanted Simon, who was five, to do the third year of
    kindergarten over again. According to her, Simon was already having
    enormous problems at school, even though he hadn’t even learn to
    read and write yet.</p>

    <p>She read the story of the little prince to the class
    and asked all the children – all of them – to draw a flock of
    sheep. And Simon drew only one goat.</p>

    <p>To her eyes, this was proof that the kid had all
    manner of problems: ‘Look at that. I asked all the kids to draw a
    flock of sheep, and Simon drew a single goat instead!’ He didn’t
    know how to count — that was the first problem. ‘And when I asked
    him where the other sheep were, Simon answered: “They are hiding
    behind the goat”’. And there was the second problem: he was lazy
    and rebellious.</p>

    <p>This child embodied all the qualities I hold dear: he
    managed to evade a normative response and, what is more, he did so
    with a poetic gesture that I found marvelous.</p>

    <p>And so I told myself that it was time to go, to
    change scenes in order to be able to invent new ones, where I would
    try to be more in sync with my own ideas. I chose the stage, a
    neutral place, a black box where everything must be reinvented with
    each new project.</p>
</div>



    <h6>… and resistance</h6>

<div>
    <p>Besides the
    phenomenon of expectation, institutional analysis, and the
    organization of power (whether liberating or not), my professional
    engagement is guided by the question of resistance.</p>

    <p>I come from <a href=
    "http://maps.google.com/maps?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=Li%C3%A8ge&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl">
    Liège</a>, a city where
    the culture of change is channeled through the idea that, to get
    what one wants, one must seek out the enemy, face him, penetrate
    the institutions of power, unseat the existing power and replace
    it.</p>

    <p>On that front, I have always been
    partisan to the idea that <em>things happen on
    the periphery and not in the centre</em>,
    as <a href=
    "http://muller-kluge.library.cornell.edu/en/video_exp.php?f=109">
    Heiner Müller</a> says. And we know
    nowadays what happened to revolutions when revolutionaries took
    power.</p>

    <p>The major split in the history of
    resistance is rather recent. It dates from the movement of the
    Indians in <a href=
    "http://books.google.be/books?id=0Rw8x4dZsf4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chiapas&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=cpOdTvegIPOK4gSSlM3CCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">
    Chiapas</a> who, with <a href=
    "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OTy3aLBSMw">Subcommander
    Marcos</a>, led a revolution whose goal was not to
    take power, but to reclaim their land, to be able to work it and to
    live on it as they wished. He is the first revolutionary not interested in power. <a href=
    "http://1libertaire.free.fr/miguel.html">Miguel
    Benasayag</a> analyzes this phenomenon very
    well: one becomes powerless when one seizes power. Currently, a
    number of resistance movements – and I think Constant is one as
    well – are working to create networks and situations in which
    people can reinvent worlds without taking power and without
    imposing their view on everyone else.</p>

    <h5>Les pas perdus</h5>

<div>
    <p>So, coming
    back to my second job: I enrolled in <a href=
    "http://www.crlg.be/template-narrow.asp?id=accueil">Liège’s Conservatory of Dramatic Arts</a> when I was thirty, to learn the craft of acting. I wanted to
    be able to start working on my own collective projects – rather
    than acting for others – as soon as possible. The bulk of my work
    tells stories about social development, but always on the poetic
    more than on a militant realistic register.</p>

    <p>With <em>Smatch</em>, I want to continue showing
    that the poetic register and that working against the grain does
    not prevent politics in the least.</p>

    <p>When I received the invitation to
    the <a href="http://www.constantvzw.org/vj12/">Jonctions Festival</a>, I reviewed my
    previous projects and noticed that, in each of them, I went against
    the grain of common sense in one way or another.</p>

    <p>The dramaturgic idea for my first
    piece, <a href=
    "http://www.lecorridor.be/Sp-pasperdus.php">les
    pas perdus</a>, was to talk about fear,
    without being overly fastidious about how. Fear is everywhere: it
    blocks us, it is paralyzing. But it is also the first survival
    mechanism. An enlarged creativity and a boundless imagination are,
    most probably, a product of fear. A person in fear imagines to him
    or herself the most beautiful scenarios in the world.</p>

    <p>It was an ambulatory performance in Liège’s abandoned
    train station. There, the audience met a number of characters who
    had lost their jobs. They had stayed at the train station after it
    was closed, and developed certain problems linked to solitude …</p>

<div class="extracts">
    <p>Il y a quelques années, il y
    avait un type qui travaillait ici, dans la gare. Il était au
    guichet. C'est lui qui remplissait les billets, qui réservait les
    places des voyageurs. Il vivait seul. La gare était devenue toute
    sa vie. Il n'imaginait pas qu'il puisse y avoir autre chose dans la
    vie en dehors du train. Il essayait de faire de son mieux pour
    qu'ils passent un bon voyage . Mais il faisait le bonheur des gens
    un peu malgré eux. Quand un couple lui demandait un billet pour
    Vienne, il voulait tellement les savoir seuls dans un tunnel qu'il
    les envoyaient à Vienne par le Mont-Blanc. Quand un gars qui avait
    des cernes sous les yeux lui demandait un billet pour Lyon, il
    l'envoyait en couchette par Marseille pour qu'il est le temps de se
    reposer.
    </p><p>
    Au bout du compte, la direction a commencé à recevoir tellement de
    lettres de réclamation à son sujet, qu'ils ont été obligés de le
    virer. Ça a été une catastrophe pour lui. Il n'avait rien d'autre
    que la gare. Alors même s'il n'y avait plus rien à y faire,
    il revenait ici tous les jours. Il
    traînait dans la gare avec cette petite valise. Il ne parlait
    plus à personne, il ne semblait pas nous
    reconnaître. Au début, il paraissait tellement perdu, qu'il
    choisissait des voyageurs à la descente du train, et il se mettait
    à les suivre. Il savait tellement peu où aller qu'il préférait que
    les autres choisissent à sa place, peu importe où.
    </p><p>
    Il suivait les gens. Mais personne ne voulait se laisser suivre par
    lui, il avait l'air tellement perdu. Personne ne voulait de lui,
    alors en désespoir de cause, il revenait à la gare dans l'espoir de
    suivre quelqu'un de plus compréhensif; Mais ça n'a jamais marché,
    alors il n'a plus quitté la gare. Il tournait en rond dans le hall.
    Il marchait bizarrement, l'air penché (il montre), il se déplaçait lentement, lentement; Parfois il essayait
    de grimper au mur, ou de rentrer dans une plaque
    d'égout.</p>
    <p>Puis un jour, il y exactement un an, il est venu à la
    consigne. Son état semblait s'être aggravé, il marchait pieds nu.
    On aurait dit qu'il avait capitulé. Il m'a tendu sa valise. Il m'a
    dit "Garde moi bien ça, c'est ce que j'ai de plus précieux au
    monde". Et puis il est parti, et on ne l'a plus jamais revu…</p>

    <h5>Le paradis des chiens</h5>

<div class="img" style="width: 180px; height: 140px">
    <img src="smatch/paradis11.jpg" />
</div>
<div>
    <p>In the
    second piece, <a href=
    "http://www.lecorridor.be/Sp-paradisdeschiens.php">le paradis des chiens</a>, there were
    seventeen old actors on the stage; eight of them were over eighty
    years-old. Six were professionals, the others were
    amateurs.</p>

    <p>While in New York for a six-month stay, I met an old
    homeless man, and I asked myself the question: what keeps him alive
    in spite of all the hardship? That led me to ask myself about how
    we might be able to speak about old age, not nostalgically, but in
    the present.</p>

    <p>I asked several old people if they would be willing
    to talk to me about their condition today and about how they could
    say that they were still alive, still able to do projects, to
    resist, fight, create … in sum, still engaged with life. </p>

    <p>We had a very small budget for a group of twenty-five
    people. Of the seventeen actors, most had never set foot on a
    stage. My expectation at the start of this adventure was the
    following: to create the possibility for people who have nothing in
    common to be able – at a particular moment and for a specific
    reason – to organize and create something as a group, in common (be
    it a theatrical piece or something else). The group consisted of
    academics, trash collectors, Walloons, Flemings, and people with
    different cultural and social backgrounds.</p>

    <p>We approached the subject through
    the metaphor, substituting a poetic discourse for the language of
    the militant. The cast had built their circus and each number
    represented, metaphorically, a social reality. (For example:
    the <em>réveil des fauves</em> sequence was a choreography in which old bodies wrapped in
    sheets swayed to the infernal cadences generated by collective
    organizations).</p>

    Another
    commission, another project: a carte blanche for a street theatre
    festival. Invent a new<em>entresort</em>, an extremely brief form:
    you walk in, see something, you walk out.<a title=
    "Footnote: An entresort is a fair or carnival attraction in which one pays to walk through and see a display. – Trans." href="#ftn1"

    the headless woman, Spiderman, the beard man or the trunk man. I wanted to question the audience’s
    voyeurism. I went against the grain of the form. That is to say: I
    created an <em>entresort</em> (<a href=

    all the codes of <a href=

    little mermaid, with perfect red hair … but, in the dry shade of a
    barge, what the audience was a mermaid drowning in its own tears (a
    mermaid can only drown in tears). 
</div>

    <p>The public listened to the sailors awestruck. We had
    cut out a window on a large vat, and when the sailors opened the

    Meanwhile, the water rose slowly until it finally drowned her. The
    last image of this beautiful scene was the corpse of the mermaid
    floating in the vat. The sailors closed the lid, and the play
    ended. The adult members of the audience were left alone with their
    problems of conscience. And the kids flooded their parents with
    questions about death and love.

    <h4>Sur les traces d'Oskar Serti</h4>

<div>
    <p>Another project that went against
    the grain: a bus ride <a href=
     "http://www.lecorridor.be/Sp-oscarserti.php"><em>sur
     les traces d’Oskar Serti</a></em>. This was a
    guided visit in which a bus followed the traces of the imaginary
    hero of plastic artist <a href=
    "http://www.corillon.org/menuPrincipal.html">Patrick Corillon</a>. The most
    pertinent place was Paris, as part of the <a href=
    "http://www.quartierdete.com/le-festival/histoire/">
    festival Paris quartier d’été</a>.</p>

    <p>The public, in the company of a driver and conductor,
    both from Eastern Europe (the actor had learned to drive the bus
    for the occasion), were taken by bus to places that ‘cannot be
    visited’ – ugly, sordid, desolate places, a no man’s land where
    everything was demolished, or where everything still had to be
    constructed. Places, in sum, where a new world could be constructed
    simply by dint of the stories narrated by the two guides.</p>

    <p>It was amusing to go against the grain of the
    expectations conjured up by a guided visit to Paris: expecting to
    visit the City of Lights, you suddenly find yourself going to all
    sort of ‘uninteresting’ places, like Aubervilliers, Saint-Denis,
    …</p>

    Chers visiteurs, nous arrivons à la fin de la
    visite. Après la rupture avec sa pianiste, nous savons
    qu’Oskar quitta&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; en 1921</p>
    <p><strong>Hermanus</strong>:
   &hellip;!!!</p>

    dans d’autres pays, dans le monde entier. Mais à la fin de sa vie,
    il revient ici, rappelé par la 
    (TV de la région où l’on effectue la
    visite). qui lui commande un
    film sur sa vie,&hellip; un film autobiographique. Après trois années de
    travail acharné, Serti acheva enfin son film, qui retraçait dans
    les moindres détails sa vie mouvementée d’exilé hongrois. Mais,
    lors de l’avant première, les producteurs refusèrent de distribuer
    un film qui durait plus de sept heures et sommèrent Oskar Serti de
    le réduire à un maximum de deux heures dix minutes. Oskar Serti ne
    pouvait voir ainsi son œuvre amputée pour une simple question
    de minutage. Après le départ des producteurs, il resta seul en
    salle de projection pour visionner une dernière fois son film dans
    l’état où il l’avait conçu. Il en profita au passage pour
    photographier l’écran avec un appareil dont le temps de pose
    correspondait exactement à la durée de son film. Après quoi, il
    détruisit toutes les copies existantes de son film. Le lendemain,
    il laissa sur le bureau des producteurs un exemplaire de cette
    photographie , leur disant que pour lui, cette trace était le
    seul résumé valable de son œuvre.</p>

</blockquote>
<div>
    <p>The
    overarching question is always the same: how to put the audience on
    its guard, how to nudge it into a joyful questioning?</p>

    <p>I had also once been asked to
    conceive a show for teenagers, and the question at the centre
    of <em>Smatch</em> 
    crystallized for me then. What I proposed was a conference
    with three panels, as it were. For that performance, we
    staged <a href=
    "http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/swift/swiftov.html">
    Jonathan Swift</a>’s <a href=
    "http://books.google.com/books?id=jmM4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=Jonathan+Swift%E2%80%99s+A+modest+proposal+for+preventing+the+children+of+the+poor+in+Ireland,+from+being+a+burden+on+their+parents+or+country,+and+for+making+them+beneficial+to+the+public&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nbmmTojnB8Tu-ga9gYXLDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">
    A modest proposal for preventing the children of the poor in
    Ireland, from being a burden on their parents or country, and for
    making them beneficial to the public</a>.
    The essay was written in 1729, and in it Swift
    suggests the following, radical solution to the problem of poverty:
    the poor could sell their one year-old babies to the rich, who
    could use them for food. This would reduce poverty, and stimulate
    the economy.</p>

    <p>I added a second panel to that: the
    biography of Nicoletta, a young Hungarian woman who had come to
    Liège and who narrated the story of her life. It bore the
    title <a href=
    "http://www.lecorridor.be/Sp-modestespropositions.php"><em>A modest testimony to prevent children from being in charge
    of all the World’s sadness and to make them in spite of everything
    aware of life’s many possibilities</em></a>.</p>

    The third panel was an initiative
    for the auto-social construction (a practice of the
    GFEN) <a title=
    "Footnote: A démarche d’auto-socio-construction is an approach practiced by the Groupe français d’education nouvelle." href="#ftn2"
    id="body_ftn2" name="body_ftn2">2</a> of a
    common knowledge around a place where it was still possible to
    resist.
</div>




    <h2>L'opéra bègue</h2>

<div>
    <p>There was
    also <a href=
     "http://www.lecorridor.be/Sp-operabegue.php"><em>>L’opéra bègue</em> (The
    stuttering opera)</a>, where one work of the title
    goes against the grain of the other. Indeed, the two words cancel
    each other out.</p>

    <p>It’s a musical piece made in
    collaboration with the philosopher <a href=
    "http://www.pieterdebuysser.com/">Pieter de
    Buysser</a> and with composer
    <a href="http://www.tienstiens.org/node/852">Dick
    Van der Harst</a>, from LOD. We used
    <a href=
    "http://books.google.com/books?id=2xAum1r8y5MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Kafka%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%98Metamorphosis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_bqmTqb-AtGN-wa785G0Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">
    Kafka’s ‘Metamorphosis</a>' as our starting point, but we
    changed the ideas.</p>

    <p>The text of Kafka’s ‘Metamorphosis’ is extremely
    powerful as well as absolutely sordid. And so we tilted the piece
    towards delirium, to allow it rouse the family (itself adrift in
    petit-bourgeois values), and to allow delirium (a young bride wakes
    up the day before her wedding with a tree growing from her mouth)
    to spark a joyful and poetic chaos. I asked Pieter to keep the
    following image in mind as he was writing the play: the members of
    the audience, as soon as they had been seated on their comfortable
    seats, had to be immediately destabilized and pushed towards a new
    discomfort, a new questioning. </p>

    <p>The set was made of mattresses, and the characters,
    caught in their comfort and their mediocre petit-bourgeois
    mentality, moved awkwardly across the soft stage.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>And then came <em>Smatch</em>.</p>
</div>





    <h1></a>Smatch</h1>

<div>
    <p><em>Smatch</em>: a <em>soirée composée</em>/performance presented
    as a laboratory for ideas. We tried to find a form in which
    different points of view could intersect, clash. Something like a
    stroll inside philosophy, art, poetry, politics, life, a stroll
    that would give the spectator the freedom to choose the path he or
    she wanted tread. Starting from an anecdote or current event, we
    tried to find an approach that would allow people (ludically, if
    possible) to construct an idea or thought together by using the
    strategy of going against the grain. The formula we used for the
    performance was one that could subsequently be varied with new
    guests and new themes. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <img src="smatch/smatch08.jpg" />
</div>
<div>
    The
    prophecy with the most traction today is that the world will come
    to end. In the shadow of that prophecy human finitude becomes the
    only possible truth. But this at the price of overlooking or
    forgetting the thousands of examples that
    attest to the human capacity for thinking, imagining, cooperating.
    It is no surprise that our societies should find themselves plunged
    into a sense of impotence and retreat that favors stasis and the
    ethos of ‘every man for himself’. We want to continue living with
    the idea that it is not over for human being and thus give humanity
    a chance to continue its construction. The starting point for this
    first <em>Smatch</em> was a
    strange map of Belgium I found in a guide to cultural institutions
    in Flanders. The northern side of the map, the Flemish side, shows
    Flanders’ various provinces, each of them illustrated with warm
    colors, and the names of various places. The southern half,
    Wallonia, conversely, is depicted in a uniform pale blue, and is
    deserted. There are only three place names: Hornu, Charleroi, and
    Eupen. Liège, Mons, Namur, and so on have all disappeared! This
    strange cartography attests to the peculiar gaze through which one
    region of the country sees the other. It is a perfect illustration
    of how the process of expectations ends up creating a new reality.
    As an answer to this rather reductive representation, I thought:
    why not populate this deserted Wallonia with intelligent animals
    and make the desert dunes sing? Given that the desert
    …

    <p>It was a nice, amusing starting point to talk about
    our concerns.</p>

    <p>How can we talk about the problem of expectations
    without incurring conflict, without wading into an extremely
    complex and long situation, as Belgian history certainly is,
    without falling into the trap of stating the obvious and taking
    recourse in clichés? We wanted to give an answer that allowed us to
    be elsewhere, an answer that would come at the question indirectly.
    We wanted to think, not against, but with difference – using the
    strategy of going against the grain. </p>

    <p>The piece opens with a projection of
    the map of Belgium and with a naïve conversation about this
    representation. We’ve put Wallonia into a sort of sea that is
    perhaps a desert, as it is not populated. And, since we were at it,
    we populated it with animals. While we discuss the issue,
    <a href=
    "http://www.lecorridor.be/videos/videosSmatch1.html">Mr. Delmotte</a>, performer</span>
    and artist, is drawing. He redraws Wallonia’s
    outline, making it look a pig, and he populates our blue part, this
    desert, with pigs … </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>The space is
    bifrontal (in echo of the two communities), but it also brings the
    audience into a lab (the public examines the issue with the
    actors). The actors are always visible and
    always very close to the audience: we are in a research space, and
    we are trying to construct meaning together throughout the length
    of the piece. Two screens are mounted on rails; they are
    mobile.</p>

    <p>We imposed a very rigid constraint
    on our starting point: an alphabet composed of the letters that
    make up the word <em>smatch</em>. It is through this alphabet that the piece articulates its
    journey through thought. We wanted to end with the word
    <em>possibilities</em>, and we
    chose to project that last word of the evening in Ducth:
    <em>mogelijkheden</em>. The word
    only appears in Dutch. </p>

    <p>Two paths intersect.</p>

    <p>The path travelled by
    <a href="http://reflexions.ulg.ac.be/cms/c_25500/we-are-made-like-rats">
    Vinciane Despret</a>, a
    philosopher who has spent more than ten years studying not only
    animals but also, and above all, scientists, trainers, animal
    lovers, and others who have strong bonds with their animals. Her
    work is about all those who have transformed the way we look at
    animals, and who have been transformed in their turn by animals.</p>

    <p>The example of the great British
    primatologist <a href=
    "http://vincianedespret.blogspot.com/2010/04/sheep-do-have-opinions.html">
    Thelma Rowell</a> is
    eloquent: after studying monkeys for fifty years, she decided,
    after having retired, to study sheep. She wanted to ask more
    intelligent questions of them then how their meat can become a
    tasty morsel on our plates. She settled on a farm in England’s wild
    countryside with a flock of sheep. She had decided to take the time
    necessary to observe them, to put them into a situation comprised
    of all the conditions that allowed the animal to be in another
    condition and to discover the capacities and the forms of
    intelligence of sheep. </p>

    <p>We read Vinciane’s books, we recorded her, we spoke
    to her at length before choosing the words we thought suitable to
    articulate the piece’s journey through thought.</p>

    <p>The first word we chose was
    <em>syntax</em>. <a href=
    "http://vincianedespret.blogspot.com/">Vinciane Despret</a>
    discusses the notion of <em>agency</em>, by which we are to understand
    the faculty of acting, of investing other worlds and other modes of
    being than the human with intentional power. She is, incidentally,
    working on the notion of <em>agency</em>
    in the dead: how to attribute intention to the
    dead?</p>

    <p>Another word, <em>contrary</em>, addressed the question of
    thinking with and not against. I recommend reading <a href=
    "http://vincianedespret.blogspot.com/">Vinciane
    Despret</a>’s <a href=
    "http://reflexions.ulg.ac.be/cms/c_12743/etre-bete"><em>Être bête</em></a>, based on her research
    on breeders and on their answers to her questions about the
    difference between being human and being animal. All breeders had
    some sort of link to the animal, and all spoke of resemblances…</p>

    <p>The show could be read on two levels. The first level
    is that of learning to know the animal better. The second is that
    of a reflection on how we can import the manner in which
    ethnologists address and study all that is foreign to us …</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>We combined
    and crisscrossed Vinciane’s path with the path of someone who
    studies the song, the music of sand dunes (since there is desert on
    the map). </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>We knew from
    the start that we wanted to talk about those two things, but we had
    no idea how we would interweave them. We pondered this on the stage
    and we found the answer together. There is a moment, for example,
    when we play with sand. This is followed by
    a short performance with layers of superimposed colours (the
    colours are those of the Belgian flag), after which
    we blow the sand, giving the illusion of the
    Belgian flag (the three colours), which appears, disappears,
    blends.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>We speak
    about animals, we speak about sand, and then we return to the human
    with the word <em>mogelijkheden</em>. Vinciane Despret
    and <a href=
    "http://www.shaviro.com/Blog/?p=401">Isabelle
    Stengers</a> talk and weave the whole thing
    together. In particular, they return to the metaphor of the desert.
    When a region becomes desert, what does one do to keep the sand
    from swallowing up a village? Building a wall is useless,
    certainly, as the sand will just go over it.</p>

    <p>Conversely, if one becomes well acquainted with the
    desert and with the village’s architecture, if one studies the wind
    and observes how the sand moves, then one can build paths that
    channel the sand in such a way that it bypasses the village without
    covering it over. A new position of resistance, a path towards new
    possibilities.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>The play
    ends with an extract from a film in which researchers – like
    children, but with the seriousness of scholars – disperse sand
    dunes by making them sing. The very last image is of the living
    fish that performing artist Mr. Delmotte has been putting into
    vials all through the play.</p>

    <p>This final image stages the clash between thought and
    sentiment: the admiration of a beautiful image is there disturbed
    by a cruel, possibly dangerous, situation. We had to open all the
    vials immediately after the end of the performance to make sure the
    fish didn’t suffocate and die. It was the occasion to continue the
    debate with a new contradiction … </p>
</div>




    <h2>Questions</h2>

<div>
    <p>A question
    from a member of the audience:</p>

    <p>I would like to know if you involve the spectator in
    the performance.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Dominique replies:</p>

    <p>In this performance, the involvement is solely at the
    level of thought.</p>

    <p>Everything has been constructed, even though it looks
    like a big mess – quite against the grain of what we usually find
    in the performing arts: a magnificently clean and sleek stage at
    the beginning, a huge chaotic mess at the end (we are rubbing
    shoulders with deconstruction).</p>

    <p>Our last strategy for going against the grain: give
    the impression of an enormous mess only to arrive, little by
    little, as things fall into place and thought moves along its
    rails, at the construction of a new knowledge … and, perhaps, at
    the beginning of a new story? </p>
