<a target="_blank" href="http://www.adashboard.org/kaleidoscope">Kaleidoscope</a> 
was a transdisciplinary research project that looked into the notion of 
collaborative authorship in the most horizontal structure possible, with nine
creators using the software <span class="it"><a target="_blank"
href="http://www.objscrs.org">Object Score Notation</a></span> 
as a platform for negociation. 
By lack of a better term the result was called a 'performance-installation', 
composed of nine games that could be played by everyone present. 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.adashboard.org/kaleidoscope">Kaleidoscope</a>
was proposed to an audience in the framework of VJ10 in La Bellone on 
25, 27 & 28 November 2009.</p>
<p>The way the project came along and the form it finally took was highly organic. 
We talk about serendipity or about one fact leading to another
when wanting to show the specificities. One thing is clear, 
<a target="_blank" href="http://data.constantvzw.org/site/-About-VJ10-.html">VJ10</a> is 
stated to be the ancestor of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adashboard.org/kaleidoscope">Kaleidoscope</a>. 
Therefore it is marked up 
in this text with the element <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_hn.asp">h1</a> from 
which different generations 
of facts were produced - h2, h3, h4, h5 - leading to h6 or 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.adashboard.org/kaleidoscope">Kaleidoscope</a> 
(the performances, the blog, the lectures, the publications) 
and to Kaleidoscope-the-next-generation that runs under the 
name <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adashboard.org/colapsekode">!Co LAPse KoDe</a> and should theoretically go under h7. As the h7 header is not 
recognized by W3C and because <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adashboard.org/colapsekode">!Co LAPse KoDe</a> 
is considered to be a new project 
with a changed combination of people, I'll go with the tool and will ignore 
!Co LAPse KoDe in this article. Other sources used can be found 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.adashboard.org/kaleidoscope/?page_id=128">here</a>.
As I'm one of the writers and initiators of the group, I take the freedom to reconstruct
the process, knowing this format allows any of the members to change the text, and
add or delete content.</p>
<p>The main idea behind Kaleidoscope was to create scores that could be executed, studied,
changed and reinserted in the computer. The source for this approach can be found in 
collectives using improvisation as a means of creation like The Scratch Orchestra, 
the Art Ensemble of Chicago or the Parliament. The first score was given to us by Tristan Honsinger and replayed in Ateliers Claus
in company of the software. Many others followed. In the beginning we took notes of the process,
of what worked and did not work. Later, when we got familiar with the software 
and started developing material-specific scores, we published them on the 
blog.</p> 
<p>The particular approach of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adashboard.org/kaleidoscope">Kaleidoscope</a> 
made tactile the notion of
'new digital disorder' as all categories started to fluctuate. Every player, for example,
was at the same time player in the game of others and director in her own game. The hierarchical
concept of amateur versus professional collapsed during the creation process, as it became
clear the amateur often explores with much more liberty the newly built environment. The immediate
relation between the two-dimensional world of the screen and the three-dimensional world of the 
stage took away the scission between spectator and player. Everyone present was potentially both 
at the same time. The only difference was that some had more site-specific previous knowledge. 
We concluded that the word 'installation-performance' was clumsy as a name, 
because we realised we had created
above all a new kind of meeting place, for people, objects and machines.

<p class="text"><a href="http://www.adashboard.org/kaleidoscope">Kaleidoscope</a> was presented in La Bellone 
on 25, 27 & 28 November 2009, each night from 18:00 till 22:00.
Visitors had the possibility to enter the space at each hour. Before entering thy received a set of cards.
We called it a <a target="_blank" href="kaleidoscope_program.pdf">program</a>. 
These cards allowed to 'read' each game, getting to know the ingredients
and the rules to play along. The makers of Kaleidoscope played a series of 4 or 5 games.
All people present could shout 'quit' to end a game and propose another game.</p>

<p>Reactions of visitors were very diverse, going from 'I didn't get a clue' to 'a nice toy!' or
'what you created is a whole new universe'. The classical set-up lead clearly to confusion, 
positioning the audience in front of the 'stage'. We would have loved to find another solution,
but we had no choice. The motion tracking software <a href="http://www.objscrs.org">objscrs</a> 
needs the least shadow possible in order to perform adequately. Light designer Michael 
Janssens therefore positioned the lights
at each side of the stage so they would merge the shadows. The tracking worked fine, but the
interaction with the audience was sometimes very difficult. The more playful visitors were those
having experience with either technology, performance or the spirit of the festival VJ.</p>

<p> 
Working with technology causes difficulties that cannot always be solved. Kaleidoscope learned us
that whatever goes wrong, the makers should always keep up appearances. In that sense, it is still
theater, spectacle, a show. We had developed an <a href="dpf.html">emergency game</a> in case of a total
system crash, but the one moment Simon the programmer was absent, we got into such a technological
panic we canceled the show. We all agreed upon the fact this was not a good decision to take. When
speaking to other makers it became clear that having just one B-plan is not enough.</p>

let's turn this into a modular game!, creation program, finalisation of the games</a></h5>
<div class="text">
<p>From 19-9-9 till 31-10-9 we worked in La Raffinerie. Here we felt the rush of going into production
mode. The games were thought through, pictures resized & made transparant, sounds decided upon
and recorded, videos converted and positioned, costumes tried out. The stress was present.
When the program needed to be made, names for concepts needed to be invented, 
compromises were made at a large scale. 
The collective turned out to have a leader anyway, even if this leader was not chosen. 
The tension was high, the immediate effect was to put aside
the improvisation and the playfullness and to start fixing things. 
Luckily, all this did not limit <a href="re_rire1.wav">the laughters</a>
that were necessary for the game <span class="it"><a target="_blank" href="9_repause.pdf">

<h5><a target="_blank" href="dpf.html" style="color:#CD003F;">Residency in De Pianofabriek: 
introduction into each other's methodologies, collective improvisations, retreat into individual
universes, emergencies (theft & universe)</a></h5>
<div class="text">
<p>De Pianofabriek KWP hosted us from 14-9-9 till 11-10-9 and from 17-11-9 till 22-11-9.
Wheras the last week helped us to finetune everything for the VJ12 festival, the first 
month was a period of rich explorings, exchanges and collaborations. We realized we all
had our working methods and visions. The main difference was the interpretation
of the concept of 'narrativity' between the dancers/musicians
and the storyteller/actress. It can be traced back to wanting to tell a <span class="it">concrete</span>
 versus an <span class="it">abstract</span>
story in a <span class="it">linear</span> versus <span class="it">fragmented</span> way.</p>
<p>The city, our daily life, pattern practices were the topics of improvisation sessions. 
The different working methods were presented in workshop-form by Laia, Lot, Rebecca, An, Dorothe and Simon.
For the musicians it seemed quite difficult to propose methods to play along, they mainly played along. 
Most of the scores can be found back <a target="_blank" 
href="http://www.adashboard.org/kaleidoscope/?cat=10">here</a>.</p>
<p>First we improvised without the machine. After each improvisation we asked the same question over
again: 'what is it the machine can add here that we cannot do ourselves?'
These sessions allowed an extensive exchange with Simon who was sort of live-coding along.</p>
<p>We also bought a suitable project computer - an old IBM Thinkpad - to make sure the software 
would not need too many changes from Simon's Thinkpad. The day we had the machine set-up with the 
newest version of objscrs, somewhere half-way our residency, we were euphoric. We started
to get onto the new code, we got our hands dirty!</p>
<p>Not for long though... One shiny morning a couple of days later, none of our gear was left. 
There had been ugly visitors in the venue.
Followed a day of watching the images on the surveillance system of De Pianofabriek. We found the two boys
<a target="_blank" href="0_entry.avi">coming in the building</a>, 
<a target="_blank" href="1_patio.avi">crossing the patio</a>, 
<a target="_blank" href="2_checking.avi">checking the exit at the back</a>, 
<a target="_blank" href="3_bags_exit.avi">taking out our bags</a> 
and <a target="_blank" href="4_exit.avi">walking out of De Pianofabriek again as 
if nothing happened</a>. Unfortunate to say that even after delivering a copy
of these video snippets to the police, we never heard back from them.</p>
<p>The robbery experience turned out to be very useful in different ways. While An got the set-up back together, 
finding a new computer, installing the software, figuring out with Simon what more additional packages
had been installed, noting down it would be good to have that information written down in a manual;
the others stayed away from the machine, developed <a target="_blank" href="7_emergency.pdf">an emergency 
game</a> that would work without the machine. 
They also defined their own games - by then still called <span class="it">universes</span>
 - on... a sheet of paper.</p>
